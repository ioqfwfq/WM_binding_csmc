MemNet: A model of image memorability trained on LaMem

The provided model is a fine-tuned version of AlexNet trained on a combination of object and 
scene categories. The provided model is in the Caffe format (http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/).
Using 10 crops per image, the model achieves a rank correlation of 0.64 on the test data. Note
that the specific model provided here has been trained on the first train/test split of the data.

We also provide the mean file and the train/deploy prototxts of the model. Please read the LICENSE
file to better understand the terms of use of this model. In short, the model is provided for
academic research and non-commercial purposes only.
